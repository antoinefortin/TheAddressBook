# Hello Foundry, I am Antoine!

Where do we start? It always feels like a generic yet challenging question to answer. Back in 2013, I studied Nuke in a compositing class during my time in college. There’s something truly unique about how one approaches creativity, and after many years of experience from the user’s perspective, I have yet to achieve what The Foundry has built.

I am deeply passionate about both the low-level and front-end aspects of software development. Coming from an industry background with a user-centric perspective, I thrive on pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with code while delivering sleek and intuitive user interfaces—all without compromising CPU and GPU efficiency.

From our discussions and the experiences I’ve gathered, I sincerely hope to join this team of passionate creators and contribute to The Foundry’s mission.
